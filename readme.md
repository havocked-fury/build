This is a very naive program to build my own small cpp projects. This is linux specific, uses system calls. The part of my file structure this uses is this:  
  
Root:  
    include:  
        Header files  
    src:  
        Cpp files corresponding to each header files  
    obj:  
        object files generated by compiling each cpp file  
    run: executable file
    test:
    	tester file
